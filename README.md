## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

*grid-templates*

I learned to implement **width** and **height** with 
`grid-templates-rows` `grid-templates-columns` `grid-templates-area` efficiently. Units like **fr**, properties set like **repeat((numbcolumns or numbers rows), 1fr)**,  `min-height` `width` sets `pecentage :%` are guides to style with ease **box** using **css grid tools**.

*Email format verification*

i didn't know how to perform an email validation.

But i fell to severals resources on the net talking on how to  implement a **check Email verification** and i use one of these to write the snippet javscript code realizing that function. 

have a look to the javascript file to see the function already mentioned..


### Continued development

This project is most about the layout of a website using CSS Grid, i had an enjoyment making the game to organize section one after one in mobile design and desktop.

 All that tease me to tackle many grid project playing with *dynamic effects*, in the future, to improve design of webpages having an accent to UX experience...
